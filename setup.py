PyAgentX2
--------------------
pyagentx2 is a fork of pyagentx, which is a pure Python implementation of AgentX protocol (RFC 2741), that
allows you to extend SNMP agent (snmpd) by writing AgentX subagents, without modifying your original SNMP agent.

The agent can support the following commands:
- snmpget
- snmpwalk
- snmptable
- snmpset
